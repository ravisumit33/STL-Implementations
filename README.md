# STL
This repository contains short, concise and simple STL implementation of all famous algorithms.

I suggest you to try yourself once before going through the solution. STL functions are used wherever possible and their likely behaviour is illustrated using a similar function defined in program. I advise you to first gain an insight into the behaviour of STL functions used by inspecting their counterparts defined and then use those STL functions whenever you require them. If you find any mistake send me a mail at ravi.sumit33@gmail.com

Thank You
